## 🧭 Overview

**SecureWipe Pro** is an AI-enhanced data sanitization and verification tool designed to ensure **complete, compliant, and irreversible deletion** of sensitive data from any connected device.  
It combines intelligent drive detection, real-time progress visualization, and certification generation — offering a professional-grade experience for IT admins, cybersecurity teams, and digital forensics professionals.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Organizations and individuals face serious risks when disposing or repurposing old drives:

- Data recovery from "formatted" drives remains possible.
- Manual sanitization is inconsistent and error-prone.
- Lack of **automated verification** or **compliance certification**.
- No visual feedback during wipe operations.

Traditional tools are either outdated, overly technical, or lack **transparency and automation**.

---

## 💡 Solution

**SecureWipe Pro** automates and enhances the entire wipe workflow by integrating:

- **AI-driven device analysis**
- **Multi-standard secure erase (DoD 5220.22-M, NIST SP 800-88)**
- **Dynamic verification and reporting**
- **Automated certificate generation**
- **Animated visual interface** for clarity and trust

The platform simplifies data sanitization while ensuring it meets global security standards.
